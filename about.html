    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
    <p>
      “People with disabilities are among the world’s most marginalized and stigmatized [...] under normal circumstances,” according to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/26/protect-rights-people-disabilities-during-covid-19&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1626307219625000&usg=AOvVaw0OZ0YO8Rt1mC2HWT1235tV">Jane Buchanan</a>, the Deputy Disability Rights director at Human Rights Watch. One billion people, which accounts for 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability. Disabled individuals are more likely to be marginalized by society, dealing with poorer health outcomes, higher unemployment, lower levels of education, and higher poverty rates (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability">The World Bank</a>). 
      <br></br>
      With COVID-19, people with disabilities have faced even greater hardships. <a href-"https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/sgsm20074.doc.htm">The UN</a> reveals how COVID-19 related deaths for senior citizens with disabilities can be as high as 72%. With the pandemic, disabled individuals have faced even greater hardships in finding employment, while only 28% of them have access to benefits. In low-income countries, this percentage is a mere 1%. In social institutions such as healthcare, people with disabilities are frequently left out in decisions regarding many social policies, according to <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/11/04/new-research-documents-how-covid-19-multiplies-stress-and-trauma-for-people-with-disabilities/">Vanderbilt University</a>. The pandemic has exacerbated fears of not having access to "health care rationing and concerns [as well as] assistive technology." In addition, individuals with developmental disabilities often live in congregate homes with increased exposure to COVID-19, and “prolonged isolation due to physical distancing and the restriction of visitors to group settings has increased depression and exacerbated cognitive, physical and mental health issues.”
      <br></br>
      Economically, people with disabilities have increased medical costs while being thrice more likely to be unemployed than an abled person. Even for those in employment, disabled adults are “segregated into low-paying, precarious non-union jobs in the food and service sectors” (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/07311214211012018#_i2">Marato, Sage Journal</a>). With the prevalence of life-threatening health concerns for disabled individuals during the pandemic, poverty and unemployment have become an even more pressing problem. Financial stability is a goal “kept out of reach by a variety of societal assumptions,” and the pandemic has backtracked its collective progress (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/covid-19-and-its-impact-persons-disabilities">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>). 
      <br></br>
      Disabled people’s opinions on the pandemic are complicated. According to a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewpulrang/2021/05/27/disabled-peoples-feelings-about-the-pandemic-are-more-complicated-than-ever/?sh%3D37fdc70231c6&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1626307557979000&usg=AOvVaw0x3_e29V5jcqrK73VGH0a0">Forbes article</a>, many individuals feel “feel anxious, undermined, and forgotten—again.” Some chronically ill people do not have access to COVID-19 vaccines, and others are at higher risks of ineffectiveness or complications from it. With the CDC releasing their mask-wearing guidelines, disabled individuals express that they “have no way to tell whether the places [they] have to go to are even partially safe.” As the world opens up, disabled people are facing increased discrimination and ableist responses from the larger society. California Governor Gavin Newsom’s decision to shift the vaccine priority to an age-based one put disabled workers at critical risk as they had to wait even longer before vaccination. In an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-26/as-californis-shifts-to-age-based-covid-19-vaccine-essential-workers-disabled-n">article by the Los Angeles Times</a>, Andy Imparato of Disability Rights California relays how healthcare guidelines for the vaccine “didn’t mention people with disabilities.”

    <h3>But hope is not lost.</h3> 
    <p>
      Organizations such as the <a href="https://disabilityrightsfund.org/covid19grantees/">Disability Rights Fund</a> have provided grants for people with disabilities to “advocate for rights and full inclusion of persons with disabilities during COVID-19 relief efforts.” In another example, anti-discrimination statewide policies for disabled individuals have been enacted due to activism during the pandemic. When a woman with an intellectual disability was taken to a small hospital in Oregon due to COVID-19, she was denied care due to her “low quality of life.” Following the thunder of disability rights advocates, Oregon Senator Sarah Gelser wrote an anti-discrimination bill that banned doctors from denying people treatment based on disability, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/21/946292119/oregon-hospitals-didnt-have-shortages-so-why-were-disabled-people-denied-care">NPR</a>. 
      <br></br>
      Still, equity for disabled communities is only at its starting point. For people with disabilities, the pandemic is far from over. People with intellectual disabilities find it “very difficult to adjust and adapt to changes required by the pandemic, [...] new routines in their daily lives, [and] interruptions in programming and services” (<a href = "https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-pandemic-isnt-over-particularly-for-people-with-disabilities-202105252464">Harvard Health Publishing</a>). Accommodation and support measures need to be enacted; halted services need to be revitalized; financial compensations should be provided to people with disabilities; and discrimination needs to stop.
